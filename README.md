        The Bible explains that God created 
        everything including us. He has the 
        right to tell us how to live. Sin 
        is the rejection of God's authority 
        over us. God is loving, and He is 
        righteous. He will not ignore sin 
        and leave the guilty unpunished.

𖨆 𝐌𝐀𝐍

        We rejected God and are guilty of 
        sin. Sin has corrupted every part of 
        our human existence. Our entire 
        being is under sin's power. The 
        penalty of sin is both physical and 
        spiritual death. Our final destiny 
        is eternal active judgment in hell.

        Jesus is fully God and fully Man.
        He came to die on the cross as a 
        Substitute for His people and to 
        pay sin's penalty. Jesus rose from 
        the dead, assuring us that God's 
        wrath is satisfied. Sinners can be 
        freed from sin's power and 
        reconciled with God.

𐂂 𝐑𝐄𝐒𝐏𝐎𝐍𝐒𝐄

        We must turn away from our sin and 
        trust in Jesus and nothing else to 
        save us from sin and the coming 
        judgment. When we repent and believe 
        in Jesus, all our sin is placed on 
        Jesus, and the perfect life Jesus 
        lived is credited to us.
